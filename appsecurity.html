            <h2>Lesson 2: Authentication and Authorization</h2>
            <p>In Lesson 2, we'll focus on the critical aspects of Authentication and Authorization in mobile app security. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users, ensuring that only legitimate users gain access to your application. We'll explore various mechanisms for secure user verification, including traditional password-based methods and more advanced techniques like biometric authentication.</p>
            <p>Authorization, the process of granting appropriate permissions to authenticated users, is equally vital. We'll delve into access control mechanisms, understanding how to safeguard different sections of your application based on user roles. Role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) will be explored, providing you with the tools to implement granular access policies in your app.</p>
            <p>To reinforce your learning, there will be a hands-on coding exercise where you'll implement a basic authentication system with password hashing and user authorization. This practical exercise will give you firsthand experience in implementing secure authentication mechanisms, a fundamental aspect of any secure mobile application.</p>

            <h2>Lesson 3: Data Encryption</h2>
            <p>Lesson 3 explores the critical topic of <strong>Data Encryption</strong> in mobile app security. Data encryption is a fundamental practice that ensures sensitive information remains confidential and secure. It involves the use of cryptographic algorithms to convert plaintext data into an unreadable format, making it indecipherable to unauthorized entities.</p>
            <p>In this lesson, we delve into both <strong>symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques</strong>. Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption involves a pair of public and private keys. Understanding the strengths and use cases of each technique is essential for implementing robust security measures in your mobile applications.</p>
            <p>End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) is a key focus, emphasizing the importance of securing data during communication between devices. Implementing E2EE ensures that even if intercepted, the data remains unreadable to third parties. We'll also cover best practices for data storage encryption, ensuring that sensitive user information stored in databases is well-protected.</p>
            <p>By comprehending the intricacies of data encryption, you'll be equipped to protect user data during transmission and storage.
