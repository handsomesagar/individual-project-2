            <h3>Introduction to Databases</h3>
            <p>Databases are the cornerstone of modern applications, providing a systematic and organized way to store,
                manage, and retrieve data. In this foundational lesson, we embark on an exploration of the fundamental
                concepts that underpin databases. We start by understanding the crucial role databases play in software
                development and explore the diverse landscape of database types. From traditional Relational Databases,
                characterized by structured tables and relationships, to NoSQL databases offering flexibility and
                scalability, and Graph Databases designed for managing interconnected data. As we delve into the
                intricacies of databases, we lay the groundwork for our journey into SQL, the language that enables
                seamless interaction with these data storage systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Topics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understanding the Role of Databases:</strong> Databases serve as repositories for structured
                    data, providing a central hub for applications to efficiently store and retrieve information.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploring Types of Databases:</strong> We examine various types of databases, including
                    Relational Databases, NoSQL Databases, and Graph Databases, each tailored to specific application
                    needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Introduction to SQL:</strong> SQL (Structured Query Language) is introduced as the standard
                    language for interacting with relational databases, allowing developers to perform tasks such as
                    querying, updating, and managing data.</li>
                <li><strong>Creating a Simple Table:</strong> Practical application of our newfound SQL knowledge begins
                    as we learn how to create a basic table to store user information.</li>

            <h3>Relational Database Design</h3>
            <p>Building upon our understanding of databases, we transition to the intricate art of designing relational
                databases. The focus is on the principles that govern the efficient organization of data. We explore
                normalization, a critical process that minimizes data redundancy and dependency, ensuring the integrity
                of the database. Visualizing these relationships becomes paramount, leading us to Entity-Relationship
                Diagrams (ERD), which serve as powerful tools for designing the connections between different entities.
                As a practical application, we design tables for a library system, applying the principles of relational
                database design to create a well-structured and efficient schema.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Topics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Principles of Relational Databases:</strong> We delve into the core principles that guide
                    the design of relational databases, emphasizing the importance of well-organized data.</li>
                <li><strong>Normalization for Data Integrity:</strong> Normalization is introduced as a key process to
                    ensure data integrity by minimizing redundancy and dependency within the database.</li>
                <li><strong>Visualizing Relationships with ERD:</strong> Entity-Relationship Diagrams become our visual
                    aid for understanding and representing the relationships between different entities in the database.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Designing Tables for a Library System:</strong> Application of relational database design
                    principles takes shape as we create tables for a library system, demonstrating how to structure data
                    effectively.</li>
